    "Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency and dispersion. Central tendency measures like the mean and median are influenced by outliers, which can shift their values significantly. Dispersion measures such as standard deviation or interquartile range can also be impacted by outliers, leading to an overestimation or underestimation of the variability of the data.\n",

    "For example, suppose a class of 30 students takes a math test, and their scores are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "87, 85, 81, 82, 83, 90, 89, 91, 84, 86, 88, 85, 81, 95, 94, 92, 84, 83, 85, 84, 85, 87, 81, 82, 83, 80, 85, 84, 89, 86\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean score of the class is (87+85+81+82+83+90+89+91+84+86+88+85+81+95+94+92+84+83+85+84+85+87+81+82+83+80+85+84+89+86) / 30 = 85.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose there was an outlier score of 60, which could be due to a student misreading the questions or not taking the test seriously. In that case, the mean score would become (87+85+81+82+83+90+89+91+84+86+88+85+81+95+94+92+84+83+85+84+85+87+81+82+83+80+85+84+89+86+60) / 31 = 83.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the outlier score significantly impacted the mean score of the class. Similarly, if we calculate the standard deviation of the original scores, it would be 4.42, but if we include the outlier score, it would increase to 6.15, indicating a higher variability than the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it's important to identify and handle outliers appropriately to avoid skewed results and to obtain accurate insights from the data.\n",
